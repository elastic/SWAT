SWAT maps closely to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, providing an interactive command-line interface and shell to simulate cyber attacks and evaluate the effectiveness of an organization's security controls. Built with Python and YAML, this tool helps detection engineers and red-teamers emulate suspicious adversary behavior against Google Workspace environments.
